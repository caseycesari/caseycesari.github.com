We published a <a href="http://axisphillyapps.tumblr.com/post/44714283089/how-we-made-the-avi-map">walk through</a> on how I made the AVI Map on AxisPhilly's new <a href="http://axisphillyapps.tumblr.com/">News Apps</a> blog.

> Once the new assessments were completed, we knew the first question would be “What will my new assessment be?” The city answered that question by sending a mailing to every property owner in the city their new value (The calculator app the city released did a good job of this as well). But we guessed that the two following questions would be “What is my neighbor’s new assessment?” and “What is everyone else in the city’s new assessment?” There was also a lot of discussion and questions around how different neighborhoods would be impacted in terms of changes in property assessments. We wanted to create an app that could answer both of citizen’s likely questions, and show the trends across the city.

It includes steps on how to create your own AVI Map.
