With much thanks to and help from Mike Bostock, today I released [us-roads](http://www.github.com/caseycesari/us-roads); a project to create a TopoJSON file of all the roads in the US.

I learned [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) from Mike Bostock's great post [Why Use Make](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make/). As he recommends, I now use Make to do a lot of the initial data gathering and processing in most of my AxisPhilly projects. Here's an [example](https://github.com/AxisPhilly/when-it-rains/blob/master/scripts/Makefile) from our [When it rains](http://apps.axisphilly.org/when-it-rains) project. The Makefile retrieves and processes all the data needed to make the [rain gage map](http://apps.axisphilly.org/when-it-rains/img/rain-gages.png) used in the story.

The project was featured, along with Mike Bostock's [us-rivers](https://github.com/mbostock/us-rivers) (the inspiration, and essentially what this project is a fork of), on [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/2013/07/16/make-your-own-us-rivers-and-roads-maps/).
